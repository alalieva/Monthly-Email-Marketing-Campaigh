# Monthly-Email-Marketing-Campaigh
This project simulates and visualizes the performance of an email marketing campaign using a synthetic dataset generated in Python.
The dataset models customer interactions with marketing emails — including opens, clicks, and purchases — over a two-year period (2023–2024).

The resulting Tableau dashboard presents key engagement metrics by month and a conversion funnel by email type, allowing analysis of campaign performance trends and customer behavior patterns.
